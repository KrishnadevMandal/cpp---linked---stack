#Custom Stack in C++

A generic stack implementation using a singly linked list.

## Features
- Template-based design
- Deep copy support (Rule of Three)
- Dynamic memeory management
- Exception-safe pop and peek
- STL-like interface

## Motivation
Built to understand how std::stack works internally and to practice memeory ownership and copy semantics in C++.

## Usage
Include stack.cpp and use like a normal stack
